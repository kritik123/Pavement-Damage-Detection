# Pavement_condition_assessment

This application is based on machine learning algorithm that can be used for assessment of pavement condition and the future prospects.
2. Everything will be done by Analysis of correlation & discovery of pattern by applying algorithm technique.
3. A deep learning algorithm which can take in an input image of pavement, assign importance to various aspects and be able to differentiate one from other. The pre-processing required in CNN algorithm is much lower as compared to other classification algorithm.
4. The algorithm will also determine the PCI value for a given photographs.
5. The entire training of ML model is done on the Google Colaboratory which gives us GPU based rendering technique to speed up the assessment of images. The training datasets is given by PMGSY and NRIDA.
